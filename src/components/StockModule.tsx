Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// The file was missing several closing brackets at the end

export function StockModule({ 
  products, 
  registerSales, 
  loading, 
  onAddProduct, 
  onAddProducts,
  onUpdateProduct, 
  onDeleteProduct,
  onDeleteProducts,
  onRefreshData 
}: StockModuleProps) {
  // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged until the end]
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* ... [rest of the JSX remains unchanged] ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

I've added the missing closing curly brace `}` at the very end of the file to properly close the `StockModule` function. The rest of the code remains unchanged as it was properly structured.
