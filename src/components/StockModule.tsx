Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// The file was missing several closing brackets at the end

export function StockModule({ 
  products, 
  registerSales, 
  loading, 
  onAddProduct, 
  onAddProducts,
  onUpdateProduct, 
  onDeleteProduct,
  onDeleteProducts,
  onRefreshData 
}: StockModuleProps) {
  // ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* ... rest of the JSX remains unchanged ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

I've added the missing closing brackets at the end of the file. The original file was missing the closing curly brace for the StockModule component function.
